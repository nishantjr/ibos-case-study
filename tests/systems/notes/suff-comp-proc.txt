Sufficient Completeness Process:

1) Handle Commatitivity
- extract all commutative ops
- commute all of their equations (this is sufficient when commutative operators occur only at the top)

2) Build linearized, unconditionalized theory
- remove all conditions from the theory
- abstract away all non-linearities
- de-dupe equations equivalent upto renaming
- build map of linearized equations to non-linear substitutions

3) Check that linearized, unconditional theory is sufficiently complete

4) Build a dependency graph for the full theory; collapse cycles into super-nodes

6) Set processed set to empty. Iterate over collapsed dependency graph by selecting super-nodes whose dependencies are all processed.
   For each super-node, process nodes in order.
   For each node, check that:
   1) non-linearities fall into known good cases
